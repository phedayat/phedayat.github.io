#### _Cookie Clicker Bot_
##### [Visit the repo](https://github.com/phedayat/sel_cookie)

Using Selenium in Python, I created a bot that plays the game ["Cookie Clicker"](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It begins by receiving 1000 clicks immediately. Each click from the script is referred to as a "rapid click". After the inital clicks, jobs for purchasing upgrades and products are scheduled. In regular intervals, they buy whatever upgrades and products they can given the cookies we have. A small GUI also appears that allows you to begin an arbitrary amount of rapid clicks or quit the bot.

I've been able to get this bot to work out of a repl to some degree of success.
