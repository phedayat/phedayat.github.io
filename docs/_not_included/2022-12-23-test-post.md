We can easily create a diagram and give it custom stylings like so.

<pre 
    class="mermaid"
    style="text-align: center; background-color: white; border: 0px solid"
>
    flowchart LR
        subgraph sg1["Subgraph 1"]
            id1["ID 1"] --> id2["ID 2"]
        end
        id2 --> id3["ID 3"]
        sg1 --> id4["ID 4"]
</pre>

I'm actually surprised at how easily I can both create the diagrams and style them to my liking.

Let's try out some math while we're here.

$$p = 100$$<br>
\\(p = 100\\)<br>

$$
    \begin{align*}
        \varepsilon &= 100 \\
            &= 200 \\
            &= 300 \\
            &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx
    \end{align*}
$$

Seems like to do in-line we can use either double $ or \\(something\,here\\)
