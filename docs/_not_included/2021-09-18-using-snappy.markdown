If you're far enough into your math degree, or are just a very passionate math enthusiast, then at some point you've heard of *__manifolds__*.

A manifold is a topological space that's locally similar to \\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\\). Depending on the context, "similar" could mean either diffeomorphic or homeomorphic. The former means that there exists a smooth bijection between two smooth manifolds (smooth meaning differentiable), and the latter means there exists a continuous bijection between them. Homeomorphic is used in the context of Topology.
