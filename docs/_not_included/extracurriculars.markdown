    <h4 class="page-heading"><i>Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students (SUMS)</i></h4>
    <h5>October 2018 - June 2022</h5>
    
    <p>
        I joined this organization in October 2018, was elected to the Publicity Committee in November 2018, and was elected to Publicity Chair in December 2018. My duties in this position include managing all SUMS social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and creating content for them. I also handle all in-person publicity, such as putting up fliers.
        <br>
        <br>
        In June 2021, I was elected to Vice President External, along with continuing my position as Publicity Chair. In this role, I'm the spokesperson for SUMS. I reach out and interact with other student organizations to set up cross-org events and facilitate the interaction between our organization and the rest of campus.

    <h4 class="page-heading"><i>Google Higher Education Summer Learning Challenge</i></h4>
    <h5>July 2021 - September 2021</h5>

    <p>
        In this program, I was enrolled in the Data Analyst track and completed a total of 48 Google Qwiklabs skill badges, 5 Google Qwiklabs quests, and a Coursera specialization.
        <br>
        <br>
        For brevity, I'll only list the quests and specialization:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Specialization: From Data to Insights with Google Cloud
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quest: Create and Manage Cloud Resources
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quest: Insights from Data with BigQuery
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quest: Explore ML Models with Explainable API
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quest: Create ML Models with BQML
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quest: Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        
        From the specialization, I earned 5 certifications, which are listed on my <a href="/certs/">Certifications</a> page

    <h4 class="page-heading"><i>OpenSource@UCSD: Leetles' Advanced Calendar</i></h4>
    <h5>February 2021 - March 2021</h5>

    <p> 
        In February 2021, I joined a group of three other UCSD students, through the student organization OS@UCSD, to create a web app around the theme "productivity during the pandemic". We set out to create an "Advanced Calendar" web app that would allow students to better manage their classes and projects across several calendars instead of a single one.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had the most experience in the group working with web apps, more specifically setting up the backend, so I naturally took on a leadership role for the project. I was the lead developer, managing my other team members' code and making sure we all followed the same convention and standards.
        <br>
        <br>
        I set up the backend using Google Cloud Platform, giving everyone roles and setting up our site to use Google Firestore to store user information. Unfortunately, the term ended before we could finish the project.

    <h4 class="page-heading"><i>Triton Unmanned Aerial Systems (TUAS)</i></h4>
    <h5>November 2019 - February 2020</h5>
    
    <p>
        TUAS is a student engineering organization focused on building autonomous planes for competition. In particular, the group builds an autonomous plane that is supposed to be able to use computer vision (CV) to recognize objects over a field.
        <br>
        <br>
        I joined in November 2019 and was a member of the software team, specifically working on image segmentation using OpenCV in Python. Unfortunately, COVID struck a little bit after that and I did not continue working with the organization.
        <br>
        <br>
        While my involvement with TUAS was short, I did gain an appreciation and interest in CV because of it.

    <h4 class="page-heading"><i>Lightning Talk: Diffential Geometry Lite</i></h4>
    <h5>February 2021</h5>

    <p>
        <a href="https://sums.ucsd.edu/talks.html#differential-geometry-lite-with-mathematica-by-parsia-hedayat">I presented a talk on the basics of Differential Geometry (DG)</a>, using visualizations I put together in Mathematica. In the talk, I very broadly covered what DG is and where/why it's used. I presented simple examples that would excite the novice mathematician, like how informative the Frenet Frame is when traversing along a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix">circular helix</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        A Lightning Talk is a short presentation meant to briefly introduce a topic or concept in mathematics to an audience. They typically range from thirty minutes to an hour.
