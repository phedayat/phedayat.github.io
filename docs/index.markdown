        <p>Hello! My name's Parsia.</p>
        <p>
            I'm a 4th year (Class of 2022) math-computer science major at UC San Diego.
            I have an interest in many fields and topics, but the most prevailing are 
            software engineering, machine learning, and data engineering/science/analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Data Engineer Intern @ <a href="https://integralads.com/">Integral Ad Science</a>. I've worked there for 3 months for a Summer Internship, and will be continuing with them for another 3 months for a Fall Internship.

            The project I worked on during the Summer, and will continue in the Fall, relates to web scraping.
        </p>
