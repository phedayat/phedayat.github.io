        <p>Hello! My name's Parsia.</p>
        <p>
            I'm a 4th year (Class of 2022) math-computer science major at UC San Diego.
            I have an interest in many fields and topics, but the most prevailing are 
            software engineering, machine learning, and data engineering/science/analytics.
        </p>

            I'm currently the Vice President External (since 2021) and Publicity Chair (since 2019) of the <a href="https://sums.ucsd.edu">Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students (SUMS)</a>. In this organization, we promote everything math! Whether you're a math enthusiast or a mathematician, you'll find a home with us.

            In February 2021, I gave a talk on the basics of Differential Geometry (DG), using visualizations I put together in Mathematica. In the talk, I very broadly covered what DG is and where/why it's used. I presented simple examples that would excite the novice mathematician, like how informative the Frenet Frame is when traversing along a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix">circular helix</a>.
