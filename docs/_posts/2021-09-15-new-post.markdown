I finally created my personal site! Only took me 2 years to finally do it.

I'm proud of having anything to put on the site in general. I'll start filling out this blog more later. I have some things to write about, maybe I'll do a survey of the things I'm working on. Part of the reason I like the idea of maintaining this blog is that I need to get over not being able to talk about myself.

Obviously the site is made with Github Pages through Jekyll, but I had so many issues _setting it up_ on my machine, that I resorted to more drastic measures. I'm maintaining the site (i.e. updating, adding, removing content and layout) through a private repl hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com). I'm pleasantly surprised that it _works_. Here's the current process for updating the site:
 1. Content
 2. Head into the repl and update/add/remove the content
 3. Use Replit's version control feature to update my corresponding private Github repo
 4. The site is updated automatically through Github actions, all set up by Github Pages

The fact that all of this works is beyond me, but I'm not complaining. Do you like the Minima theme? I know it's "stock", but it looks good.
