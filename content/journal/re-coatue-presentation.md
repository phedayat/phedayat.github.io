My main takeaways are:
- Demand and adoption for (consumer-grade) AI is on the rise
- We should invest in companies that work on semiconductors (for the production of more and/or better GPUs)
- We should be investing in companies that *build* GPUs (e.g. Nvidia)
- We should invest in companies that build solutions for AI Ops (LLM Ops, GenAI Ops) (e.g. Databricks)
	- This is mostly engineering
	- Example of tools used in AI Ops: vector databases
		- Examples of vector databases: [AWS Opensearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/)
- We should invest in on-device AI
	- This refers to both applications which utilize an API to access models, and models which are small enough to fit directly on the device
		- Apple does this already; you have Optical Character Recognition (OCR) built into your phone
	- Empowering research symposiums like [TinyML](https://www.tinyml.org/) would really drive on-device AI development
- GenAI increases white-collar productivity
- GenAI has birthed a new space of AI-powered developer tools, including integrations into existing tooling
- Research on and improvement of synthetic data could prevent data scarcity
- Challenges in the AI space (scalability, cost, and computational performance) are generally engineering and hardware problems; they relate less to the model, and more to the infrastructure that supports it.
