Here I write some math. $x \in \mathcal{L}$
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx
$$

I wonder how I can incorporate Typst into my website? Should I engage in another overhaul redesign, this time starting from scratch with proper Hugo? It seems like a both good and viable idea.

Ideally, I would simply recreate the current theme myself, from scratch, without doing anything hacky like I feel had been done with the theme I'm using now.

The most important things I want my site to support are:
- Markdown
- LaTeX (or Typst, but I don't think that's offered yet)
- Mermaid (or some kind of diagramming module)

In fact, it makes the most sense to simply make this from scratch since I have no idea how anything is setup on this... I wonder if the site works on my Apple Watch?
