<p>Using Selenium in Python, I created a bot that plays the game <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">‚ÄúCookie Clicker‚Äù</a>. It begins by receiving 1000 clicks immediately. Each click from the script is referred to as a ‚Äúrapid click‚Äù. After the inital clicks, jobs for purchasing upgrades and products are scheduled. In regular intervals, they buy whatever upgrades and products they can given the cookies we have. A small GUI also appears that allows you to begin an arbitrary amount of rapid clicks or quit the bot.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been able to get this bot to work out of a repl to some degree of success.</p>

<p>Built using Python with Turtle, I wrote a script that generates stars of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> vertices repeatedly. Basically it draws stacked stars. The stars are drawn using simple geometric formulas for regular polygons. They direct what the turtle does for any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>-sided polygon.</p>

<p>The script is easily runnable through a repl, and in fact the first mockup was made there.</p>
