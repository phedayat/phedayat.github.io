I"Y<p>I finally created my personal site! Only took me 2 years to finally do it.</p>

<p>I’m proud of having anything to put on the site in general. I’ll start filling out this blog more later. I have some things to write about, maybe I’ll do a survey of the things I’m working on. Part of the reason I like the idea of maintaining this blog is that I need to get over not being able to talk about myself.</p>

<p>Obviously the site is made with Github Pages through Jekyll, but I had so many issues <em>setting it up</em> on my machine, that I resorted to more drastic measures. I’m maintaining the site (i.e. layout and updating, adding, removing content) through a private repl hosted on <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>. I’m pleasantly surprised that it <em>works</em>. Here’s the current process for updating the site:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Head into the repl and update/add/remove the content</li>
  <li>Use Replit’s version control feature to update my corresponding private Github repo</li>
  <li>The site is updated automatically through Github actions, all set up by Github Pages</li>
</ol>

<p>The fact that all of this works is beyond me, but I’m not complaining. Do you like the Minima theme? I know it’s “stock”, but it looks good.</p>

<p>After many hours of working on the site, I’ve reached a point where editing is very streamlined and I know exactly where to look if I want to change something. I even added the little LinkedIn logo to the footer, using an SVG I found. All in all, very pleased with how this turned out. Looking forward to keeping it updated.</p>
